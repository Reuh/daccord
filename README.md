Work-in-progress MPD client. You probably don't want to use it now.

You may be interested howerver in the MPD client library mpc.lua (Lua 5.1-5.3 with luasocket) in this repository, which supports every MPD command and seems to work pretty well. Licensed under a different license (MIT/X11-like) than this repository, see the mpc.lua file. I may make a dedicated repository if there's interest, and I'm not too lazy to write documentation and examples.
